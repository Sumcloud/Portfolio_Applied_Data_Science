## Reflection on group project contributions

I didnt't have a specific role during this project, I think I did a bit of everything. However, most of my time has been spent has been spent on both research and the writing of the research paper. I didn't do much on the pipeline but I did work on adding imputation methods found in previous literature and visualizations to visualize method performance.

### Personal STARR-based reflection on writing the paper   <br></br>

**Situation:**  
In the month of December, it was thought that the Research paper was further along than it was at the time. To finish or get close to finishing the paper a time window of a month and a half was created. In the first week of December, it turned out there was not a lot done yet. Which left three weeks before the Christmas break to get a close to the final version draft done. The research was also still very light to support the paper so that needed some work too
Accompanying research for the paper was also in need of improvement to get a starting point for our paper.

**Task:**  
Write the research paper and improve on it iteratively based on the feedback given by teachers and group members. Whilst writing reinforce the research paper with previous literature on the subject. Whilst writing the paper also look for what visualizations to include for getting the point across better.

**Action:**  
I started writing the paper on the third of December and added the required research from what I had read before and was reading. To get everything correct in terms of technical details for our paper I asked every person for a detailed description of how the technical aspects work. These descriptions were rewritten to be included in the paper. 
To get as much feedback as possible I arranged for extra meetings with teachers and made a live document on google drive for group members to give feedback in real-time. Because of the late start, I worked hard on this until the final weekend of the Christmas break. Every three days a new version was sent for feedback during the vacation.
Whilst researching I also made suggestions as to what figures would help get our point across well and later, I wrote code that gave better insight data for our personal evaluation and for the final paper.

**Result:**  
A formatted research paper was written to communicate the research done during this project. Iteratively written to get as much feedback as possible to make sure there were no misinterpretations. Including 3 or 4 figures that were made by me.

**Reflection:**  
Because of the unexpected late start with writing the paper I had to spend a lot of the Christmas break working on the paper. Due to the writing style and other people being busy or not available during the Christmas vacation I wrote the paper mostly by myself. If I had to do this over again, I would probably have checked on the paper sooner to prevent losing time. With writing the paper I would have liked to be more inclusive by convincing other people to write too. Aside from that, I think I communicated clearly what my progress was and what needed feedback to my group members.


## Reflection on own learning objectives  

---
I wanted to use this minor to get an introduction to data science so that I could get an impression on if it is something that interests me as a career choice. I had no specific learning objectives in mind when starting this semester but during the minor, I developed a couple of learning objectives that I wanted to achieve. These were:

1. Writing and submitting a research paper
2. Competency in Python programming
3. Using visualizations and data to draw and support sound conclusions.

I have written research reports and essays before but never a formatted research paper. During this semester I tried to write a well-written paper that could be accepted at an official conference. I personally enjoy writing and feedback given by teachers and our problem owner has given me a better understanding of writing papers.  

I had used Python before but only as a quick scripting language for formatting documents or quick calculations, but it never got much deeper than this. Through the data camp courses, I got a more in-depth understanding of Python programming in normal Python and for Jupyter Notebook. Using Python to make quick and easy visualizations of data has been something I wanted to do for some time and has been a definite highlight for me in terms of Python competency. 

Aside from writing the paper I also wanted to learn about how to make conclusions based on data and its visualizations for a project like this. Learning this and applying the skill in Python and in writing a paper is going to be an asset for later. <br></br>    

### STARR-based reflection on learning objectives  


**Situation:**  
After the pipeline had finished running the imputations and evaluating the selected methods it created a CSV file filled with performance metrics per imputation performed.  The results need to be properly formatted, visualized and studied to make sound conclusions to our research for the paper. This then needed to be written down in a readable fashion for our paper. For the paper a selection of what visuals to include also needed to be made since there was a limit on how many visuals could be included for the conference the paper was going to be submitted to.

**Task:**  
Get the results from the pipeline create visualizations based on the metrics and raw data also format them to make them readable in text. When that is done analyze and study the results achieved by our selected imputation methods and compare them to get the conclusion for our research paper. 

**Action:**  
When the results were in, I downloaded them from the pipeline (Jupyter Notebook server) and loaded them into a visualization script that I wrote. The script automatically generated visuals for the results on selected criteria in the results.csv file. When the results were visualized, I started analyzing the data visualized and in text form to draw conclusions.  

**Result:**  
A sound conclusion was made on the results gotten from the comparison experiment done during our research. The conclusion in the research paper was properly structured and easy to understand for the reader. Visualizations selected for the conclusions also give a visual insight into the performance of the selected imputation methods that further support our conclusion.

**Reflection:**  
Due to the Christmas break, it was hard to get all the group members into one call to give a consensus for our conclusion. To make it work I tried to be as transparent as possible on how the conclusion was made using visuals and data points. I think I succeeded in giving people clear insight into how and why the conclusions were made. 

Thinking back, I would have liked more meetings with the whole group at once to discuss the results in one go. Instead, I made sure to hear everyone’s opinion in some way or form in a different call or in text format. I would have liked to make more visualizations for the paper but due to restrictions in formatting that wasn’t allowed.   <br></br>


## Evaluation of the group project    

--- 

Our group had people of various nationalities, which meant we had to communicate in English instead of Dutch. This was my first English project although I have written English reports before. All group member’s English-speaking abilities were great, but it still felt hard at times to communicate specific parts of the project. Sometimes it felt in speaking and hearing that the semantics of what some was trying to say fell off which created some small inconsistencies in collaboration.

I think we all got along during this project and the arguments we did have were solved in a mature manner. 

### STARR-based reflection on taking more of a leadership role in the last weeks<br></br>

**Situation:**  
During the last weeks of the project, we as a project group felt a bit aimless. Some group members weren’t sure of what they should do but they also were not asking. We were stuck at the evaluation part of the research which made progressing further harder. Exchange students were also going back to their home countries which made physical meetings with the whole group impossible. The fact that all communication now had to be digital, and the holidays made it harder to keep progress steady. 

**Task:**  
Make sure everyone has a task to do for the research project and what their work entails. Deadlines also need to be made clear for keeping progress as smooth as possible when working individually.

**Action:**  
Because I was writing the paper, I had the best overview of what had to be done still to complete our research. When looking at Jira and asking people what they were working on I got an understanding of who was doing what and was available to complete the tasks to be done.
When working physically together at school I asked people in person at school what they were working on and if they could finish a part still to be completed. I also discussed the things I was missing in the research with the group, so everyone understood who did what. While working online I did mostly the same I messaged everyone individually on what needed to be done and when and in the WhatsApp group I also announced who did what. 
On January 4th we met to finish the paper and for that, the task people were tasked with needed to be done. To make it clearer on what was expected from everyone I created an agenda points document. Jan 4th didn’t turn out to be the finishing date but for the other days, I created a similar document or message.

[Example of agenda point document](/Research%20Project/Agenda_points_for_jan_4th.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Image agenda point document</summary>
  <img src="/Research%20Project/Image_Agenda_Points_Document.png" alt='image agenda point document'>
</details>  

**Result:**  
Clearer coordination and communication within the group everyone knew what they were supposed to do before Jan 4th and other dates. It also helped writing the paper because it made it easier to communicate when a new version of the paper was ready for feedback.

**Reflection:**  
The group should probably have appointed someone as a ‘leader’ it felt we were a bit aimless at times. This was also due to some people being very reactive instead of active. Whether it was me or someone else doesn’t really matter to me. But I feel that if I started being more assertive earlier on in the project, we could have had a more balanced workload for the pipeline and paper. This would probably have resulted in a more gradual improvement too compared to the explosive bursts we had in progress.
