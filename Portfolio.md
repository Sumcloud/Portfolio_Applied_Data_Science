## Sources used for learning about Imputation


# **Subject #3:** Data Preprocessing

## Visualizations

# **Subject #4:** Communication

## Presentations

**Internal presentations I created and presented:**
- [**Internal presentation December 6**](/Presentations/Internal_Week_6.pptx)
- [**Internal presentation November 8**](Presentations/Internal_November_8.pptx)
- [**Internal presentation December 20**](Presentations/Internal_December_20.pptx)

**For each presentation I created the following file structure:**
```
  Presentation folder/
    Images/
      image_1.png
    Presentation file week X.pptx
    Work Description per person.docx
```

The word document was used for everyone to describe their work in the last weeks. The Images folder was used to add visuals for the powerpoint. I found this structure to be the most clear and easy to use when working on this group project.

# Feedback
As a group we forgot to make use of the 360 degree feedback tool. To make up for this I decided to ask for feedback on personal performance for this portfolio. **NOTE!:** I did get 
permission to include their feedback in this portfolio.

## Feedback for others
<details>
  <summary>Adrien Lucbert</summary>

  **+** Hardworking  
  **+** Active contributions during group only meetings or with teachers  
  **+** Enthusiastic  
  **-** Didn't ask for help  

  **Explanation:** 
  Adrien has been an absolute pleasure to work with during this semester, he was a hard worker and was one of the few people who actively contributed during meetings either internal or with teachers. At times he pulled too much work towards him, this created a bit of an uneven workload. He did his work without asking for other people to assist him in his work, which made it harder for people to assist him when needed. In the end, his enthusiastic attitude and contributions have been vital to the success of our project.

  <summary>Albert Corson</summary>

  **+** Active contributions during group only meetings or with teachers  
  **+** Hard worker  
  **-** Communication and coordination was hard at times  
  **Explanation:**
  Overall Albert has been a pleasure to work with, he was a big contributor to the project with the custom Hot Deck method and improvements to the pipeline. He was also one of the few people during meetings who would speak up and ask for clarification during meetings internal or with teachers. Coordinating was a bit hard at times but that is was mostly when working online and those problems subsided when we moved to in person when it was possible.

<details>
  <summary>Jesús Martínez De Juan</summary>

  **+** Adept  
  **-** Was hard to communicate and coordinate with  
  **-** Was passive during meetings  
  
  **Explanation:** To be honest I haven't worked with Jesús much because he was largely focused on Neural Networks from the start of the project. During meetings he didn't add much and needed to be asked in order to contribute.  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Michael Weij </summary>  

  **+** Good communication  
  **+** Good attitude  
  **-** Could have helped with Research    

  **Explanation**
  Michael and I haven't worked on the same taks during the project so I can't speak to the indiviudual quality of work aside from the LaTeX format due to his work being largely collaborative. I found his attitude during the project to be sharp and his punctuality for deadlines to gives me the same feeling.

<details>
  <summary>Ramon van der Elst </summary>  

  **+** Good at presenting especially the external presentations  
  **+** Good critical feedback on paper  
  **-** Didn't ask for help  
  **-** Passive during meetings group only and with teachers

  **Explanation:** Ramon's part for this project was writing the paper and researching previous studies to make writing the paper and the research process easier. During the last month a lot had to be done on his earliest draft of the paper, due to the fact that he had never asked for feedback from us or the teachers. The research he did also didn't overlap quite well to what was required in terms of technical aspects of the paper. This was largely due to him not asking questions for technical processes that the other group members were working on. This also showed in his paper where some clear misconceptions and lack knowledge of ongoing technical processes were apparent. In the last weeks I rewrote his first version and added some papers that I found during research. His feedback has been important for the improvement of the paper and his presentation skills were also a big help to communicating the goals, processes and results of our research.
