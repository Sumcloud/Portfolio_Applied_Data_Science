## Reflection on group project contributions  

---  
  
I didn't have a specific role during this project, I think I did a bit of everything. When writing pieces for the research paper and proposal I took lead and my main focus has been on that in the early and late stages of the project. I didn't do much on the pipeline as that was mainly Adrien and Albert working on that. I did add imputation methods found in previous literature. To help visualize the evaluation metrics I did create visualizations to get a better insight into the performance.

### Personal STARR-based reflection on writing the paper <br></br>
**Situation:**  
In the month of December, it was thought that the Research paper was further along than it was at the time. To finish or get close to finishing the paper a time window of a month and a half was created. In the first week of December, it turned out there was not a lot done yet. Which left three weeks before the Christmas break to get a close to the final version draft done. The research was also still very light to support the paper so that needed some work too
Accompanying research for the paper was also in need of improvement to get a starting point for our paper.

**Task:**  
Write the research paper and improve on it iteratively based on the feedback given by teachers and group members. Whilst writing reinforce the research paper with previous literature on the subject. Whilst writing the paper also look for what visualizations to include for getting the point across better.

**Action:**  
I started writing the paper on the third of December and added the required research from what I had read before and was reading. To get everything correct in terms of technical details for our paper I asked every person for a detailed description of how the technical aspects work. These descriptions were rewritten to be included in the paper. 
To get as much feedback as possible I arranged for extra meetings with teachers and made a live document on google drive for group members to give feedback in real-time. Because of the late start, I worked hard on this until the final weekend of the Christmas break. Every three days a new version was sent for feedback during the vacation.
Whilst researching I also made suggestions as to what figures would help get our point across well and later, I wrote code that gave better insight data for our personal evaluation and for the final paper.

**Result:**  
A formatted research paper was written to communicate the research done during this project. Iteratively written to get as much feedback as possible to make sure there were no misinterpretations. Including 3 or 4 figures that were made by me.

**Reflection:**  
Because of the unexpected late start with writing the paper I had to spend a lot of the Christmas break working on the paper. Due to the writing style and other people being busy or not available during the Christmas vacation I wrote the paper mostly by myself. If I had to do this over again, I would probably have checked on the paper sooner to prevent losing time. With writing the paper I would have liked to be more inclusive by convincing other people to write too. Aside from that, I think I communicated clearly what my progress was and what needed feedback to my group members.



## Reflection on own learning objectives  

---
I wanted to use this minor to get an introduction to data science so that I could get an impression on if it is something that interests me as a career choice. I had no specific learning objectives in mind when starting this semester but during the minor, I developed a couple of learning objectives that I wanted to achieve. These were:

1. Writing and submitting a research paper
2. Competency in Python programming
3. Using visualizations and data to draw and support sound conclusions.

I have written research reports and essays before but never a formatted research paper. During this semester I tried to write a well-written paper that could be accepted at an official conference. I personally enjoy writing and feedback given by teachers and our problem owner has given me a better understanding of writing papers.  

I had used Python before but only as a quick scripting language for formatting documents or quick calculations, but it never got much deeper than this. Through the data camp courses, I got a more in-depth understanding of Python programming in normal Python and for Jupyter Notebook. Using Python to make quick and easy visualizations of data has been something I wanted to do for some time and has been a definite highlight for me in terms of Python competency. 

Aside from writing the paper I also wanted to learn about how to make conclusions based on data and its visualizations for a project like this. Learning this and applying the skill in Python and in writing a paper is going to be an asset for later. <br></br>    

### STARR-based reflection on learning objectives  


**Situation:**  
After the pipeline had finished running the imputations and evaluating the selected methods it created a CSV file filled with performance metrics per imputation performed.  The results need to be properly formatted, visualized and studied to make sound conclusions to our research for the paper. This then needed to be written down in a readable fashion for our paper. For the paper a selection of what visuals to include also needed to be made since there was a limit on how many visuals could be included for the conference the paper was going to be submitted to.

**Task:**  
Get the results from the pipeline create visualizations based on the metrics and raw data also format them to make them readable in text. When that is done analyze and study the results achieved by our selected imputation methods and compare them to get the conclusion for our research paper. 

**Action:**  
When the results were in, I downloaded them from the pipeline (Jupyter Notebook server) and loaded them into a visualization script that I wrote. The script automatically generated visuals for the results on selected criteria in the results.csv file. When the results were visualized, I started analyzing the data visualized and in text form to draw conclusions.  

**Result:**  
A sound conclusion was made on the results gotten from the comparison experiment done during our research. The conclusion in the research paper was properly structured and easy to understand for the reader. Visualizations selected for the conclusions also give a visual insight into the performance of the selected imputation methods that further support our conclusion.

**Reflection:**  
Due to the Christmas break, it was hard to get all the group members into one call to give a consensus for our conclusion. To make it work I tried to be as transparent as possible on how the conclusion was made using visuals and data points. I think I succeeded in giving people clear insight into how and why the conclusions were made. 

Thinking back, I would have liked more meetings with the whole group at once to discuss the results in one go. Instead, I made sure to hear everyone’s opinion in some way or form in a different call or in text format. I would have liked to make more visualizations for the paper but due to restrictions in formatting that wasn’t allowed.   <br></br>


## Evaluation of the group project    

--- 


Our group had people of various nationalities, which meant we had to communicate in English instead of Dutch. This was my first English project although I have written English reports before. All group member’s English-speaking abilities were great, but it still felt hard at times to communicate specific parts of the project. Sometimes it felt in speaking and hearing that the semantics of what some was trying to say fell off which created some small inconsistencies in collaboration.

I think we all got along during this project and the arguments we did have were solved in a mature manner. 

### STARR-based reflection on taking more of a leadership role in the last weeks<br></br>

**Situation:**  
During the last weeks of the project, we as a project group felt a bit aimless. Some group members weren’t sure of what they should do but they also were not asking. We were stuck at the evaluation part of the research which made progressing further harder. Exchange students were also going back to their home countries which made physical meetings with the whole group impossible. The fact that all communication now had to be digital, and the holidays made it harder to keep progress steady. 

**Task:**  
Make sure everyone has a task to do for the research project and what their work entails. Deadlines also need to be made clear for keeping progress as smooth as possible when working individually.

**Action:**  
Because I was writing the paper, I had the best overview of what had to be done still to complete our research. When looking at Jira and asking people what they were working on I got an understanding of who was doing what and was available to complete the tasks to be done.
When working physically together at school I asked people in person at school what they were working on and if they could finish a part still to be completed. I also discussed the things I was missing in the research with the group, so everyone understood who did what. While working online I did mostly the same I messaged everyone individually on what needed to be done and when and in the WhatsApp group I also announced who did what. 
On January 4th we met to finish the paper and for that, the task people were tasked with needed to be done. To make it clearer on what was expected from everyone I created an agenda points document. Jan 4th didn’t turn out to be the finishing date but for the other days, I created a similar document or message.  


[Example of a agenda point document](/Research%20Project/Agenda_points_for_jan_4th.docx)  
<details>
  <summary>Image agenda point document</summary>
  <img src="/Research%20Project/Image_Agenda_Points_Document.png" alt='image agenda point document'>
</details>  


**Result:**  
Clearer coordination and communication within the group everyone knew what they were supposed to do before Jan 4th and other dates. It also helped writing the paper because it made it easier to communicate when a new version of the paper was ready for feedback.

**Reflection:**  
The group should probably have appointed someone as a ‘leader’ it felt we were a bit aimless at times. This was also due to some people being very reactive instead of active. Whether it was me or someone else doesn’t really matter to me. But I feel that if I started being more assertive earlier on in the project, we could have had a more balanced workload for the pipeline and paper. This would probably have resulted in a more gradual improvement too compared to the explosive bursts we had in progress. 


# **Subject #1:** Research project  

The imputation research project is a project which purpose was to create a guideline for imputing Building management(BMS) time series data. The client for this project was the research group Energy in Transistion (EiT), a research group from THUAS. EiT provided us with a dataset of BMS data of 120 houses during 2019 built by Factory Zero. During the project we had constant contact with a researcher from the group, Mr. Baldiri Salcedo Rahola.

BMS's record values at a five minute interval but due to sensor or data storage error these values can be lost. These losses can create inconsistencies down the line in applications that make use of the data generated by these BMS's an example of this forecasting which has been proven to perform worse when making use of incomplete data sets.

From preliminary research and talking to the client and teachers we quickly realized that there probably wouldn't be one method fits all solution. Which is why it was decided to form a guideline of specific methods to use in certain scenarios. This lead us to the following questions:

**Main-question:**
 - Which imputation techniques should be applied for data imputation in building energy time series data?

**Sub-questions:**
  1. What imputation methods are known for imputing time-series data?
  2. Which imputation methods are best suited for what gap sizes
  3. What imputation methods are best suited for which types of data?

From research done in the first weeks of the project we found that some methods will most likely perform better on certain data classifications. Gap size or percentage of data missing also seemed to matter due to some methods performing worse when gaps get bigger.

In the final paper our main question was answered by creating a guideline for which imputation method to use in what scenario. Subquestion #1 served as an orientation question to what method had precedent for imputing time series data. The second and third scenario form scenarios in which imputation takes place. Gap sizes vary in real data. This was mirrored in the artificial gaps to evaluate the performance on the various gap sizes present in data.

## Conclusion of the research project

## Further research
This research project only evaluated imputation methods on known evaluation metrics and if they could follow a trend in data or not. Further research should focus on evaluating the imputation methods performance based on the impact of forecasting data with the imputed values.

Another interesting angle to building upon this paper would be creating a more generic plug 'n play model. Guidelines are a good start but making a model that says this method is the best in scenario X and applies said method automatically would be the next step.

## Planning
At the start of the project we made a verbal agreement on what to finish when. Our goal was to present the research phases during the external presentations but we deviated from that when it came into practice. During the first weeks we had meetings once or twice a week but later on we upped that to daily meetings.

For visualizing our KANBAN board we made of use of JiRA. Tasks were added weekly on Thursdays after meeting together and with teachers and at the end of each sprint we added backlog tasks for the next one. We didn't do traditional retrospectives but at the end of each sprint (which was always a Thursday) we discussed what we had done and what needed extra attention for the next sprint.

# **Subject #2:** Domain Knowledge

This project was focussed on the imputation of missing time series data, specifically BMS time-series. BMS's generate a lot of data from various sensors some of its data includes: temperature, power usage, generated power and co2 level meassurements.

Power usage is an especially hard field to impute due to its volatile nature. Meaning that power usage can suddenly go up or down if someone turns on a big appliance.  

In previous literature we found that evaluating imputation was done by using the Root Mean Squared Error. In our preliminary (non-final) results we saw that the RMSE scores were quite high. On closer inspection of the data it was visible that some methods did predict trends but they were slighly later in time compared to the original.

Whilst RMSE is common use to score accuracy in imputation for our study it was less viable as the average error was not our focus. That is not to say that RMSE is a useless metric, if an imputation method doesn't follow trends it will be visible in the RMSE as well. 

For evaluation we also made use of statistics like the Skewness and Kurtosis to see how imputation impacted the distribution of the data.

## Writing the paper  

---  

As stated in my learning objectives I wanted to create a paper based on our research and submit it to the CLIMA conference. I have both written the Research proposal and the final paper and asked for constant feedback on what can be improved.  

**Research Proposal:**  
To get on the same line with each other in the group and with the client and teachers a research proposal was created. During the project we deviated from some of the outlines in the proposal but I see that as only natural due to it being very early on in this minor.  

*Parts that I wrote for the research proposal:* Introduction, Research Questions, Background & context, abstract, Methodology

**Reseach paper:** 

For the paper I wrote the following: Introduction, Abstract, Methodology (Except for Hot Deck and Recurrent Neural networks), Results and Discussion. I adjusted to feedback given by teachers especially Baldiri gave a lot of feedback. He shortened my sentences by large amounts and I adapted to his feedback. 

***Proof of work:***

- Google docs version of paper [link]()
- Version control screenshots: [Screen_shot_1](), [Screen_shot_2]()

**The google doc was a bit older because I switched to word as that was easier because I didn't have a stable internet connection. This means the google doc VSC doesn't have my time spent during the Christmas break. I do however have two versions in seperate files (due to sending them in for feedback). These do not display all time spent on writing the paper but do give an indication**

He has been someone we could rely on to get the work done and was willing to tackle literature work, which allowed most of us to focus on the practical work. But I feel like he has been less present at times, and working too much at other times, especially at the end, which could sometimes be hard for him to handle.

  **+** Good desire to work
  **+** Some previous knowledges  
  **+** Productivity even when Julien had to quarantine  
  **-** Spending too much time in methods that didn't worked at the end (but we didn't know previously)  

  **Explanation:** I'm glad to have worked with Julien and all the members of the group. He has always good willing to work and he took the lead in taking notes of all the meetings we had so we can have the main important points clearly.

  **+**  Julien took up to do most of the communication within the team which was really nice. Which made it easy to know what everybody was responsible for.  Because of that it was easy to work together.
  
  **-**  In the second half we decided to work more on site so we could finish the project in time. But most of the time you still decided to work from home. I think it was better for the project if you were more on site overall.  


  **Explanation:** It was nice working with Julien he did everything he was said he was going to do and made sure everybody was on the right track.

## Feedback for others
<details> 
  <summary>Adrien Lucbert</summary>

  **+** Hardworking  
  **+** Active contributions during group only meetings or with teachers  
  **+** Enthusiastic  
  **-** Didn't ask for help  

  **Explanation:** 
  Adrien has been an absolute pleasure to work with during this semester, he was a hard worker and was one of the few people who actively contributed during meetings either internal or with teachers. At times he pulled too much work towards him, this created a bit of an uneven workload. He did his work without asking for other people to assist him in his work, which made it harder for people to assist him when needed. In the end, his enthusiastic attitude and contributions have been vital to the success of our project.

  **+** Active contributions during group only meetings or with teachers  
  **+** Hard worker  
  **-** Communication and coordination was hard at times  
  **Explanation:**
  Overall Albert has been a pleasure to work with, he was a big contributor to the project with the custom Hot Deck method and improvements to the pipeline. He was also one of the few people during meetings who would speak up and ask for clarification during meetings internal or with teachers. Coordinating was a bit hard at times but that is was mostly when working online and those problems subsided when we moved to in person when it was possible.

  <summary>Jesús Martínez De Juan</summary>

  **+** Adept  
  **-** Was hard to communicate and coordinate with  
  **-** Was passive during meetings  
  
  **Explanation:** To be honest I haven't worked with Jesús much because he was largely focused on Neural Networks from the start of the project. During meetings he didn't add much and needed to be asked in order to contribute.

  **+** Good communication  
  **+** Good attitude  
  **-** Could have helped with Research    

  **Explanation**
  Michael and I haven't worked on the same taks during the project so I can't speak to the indiviudual quality of work aside from the LaTeX format due to his work being largely collaborative. I found his attitude during the project to be sharp and his punctuality for deadlines to gives me the same feeling.

  <summary>Ramon van der Elst </summary>  

  **+** Good at presenting especially the external presentations  
  **+** Good critical feedback on paper  
  **-** Didn't ask for help  
  **-** Passive during meetings group only and with teachers

  **Explanation:** Ramon's part for this project was writing the paper and researching previous studies to make writing the paper and the research process easier. During the last month a lot had to be done on his earliest draft of the paper, due to the fact that he had never asked for feedback from us or the teachers. The research he did also didn't overlap quite well to what was required in terms of technical aspects of the paper. This was largely due to him not asking questions for technical processes that the other group members were working on. This also showed in his paper where some clear misconceptions and lack knowledge of ongoing technical processes were apparent. In the last weeks I rewrote his first version and added some papers that I found during research. His feedback has been important for the improvement of the paper and his presentation skills were also a big help to communicating the goals, processes and results of our research.
